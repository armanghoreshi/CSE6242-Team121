------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the code, data, and visualizations for analyzing the impact of remote work on U.S. real estate
markets, using regression models and interactive maps to identify high-growth counties and trends for real estate development.
The project is consist of multiple Jupyter Notebooks for data cleaning, data transformation, and predictions. The small
datasets are available in the repo but the bigger datasets are linked for download. At last the results from these Jupyter
Notebooks are fed into Tableau for an interactive visualizations.

Please find the description of each of the Jupyter Notebooks here:

1. County Labeling And Adjacency.ipynb
This notebook uses population and housing density to determine a metro county per state. Then it uses county adjacency data
to find which counties are neighbours to the metro county up to 5 levels.

2. Modeling-v4.ipynb
This notebook integrates and processes data from multiple sources, performing transformations and cleaning to prepare the final dataset for regression modeling. 
It includes the construction of regression models, evaluation of their performance, and detailed analysis of the results.
